                Agent with the information specified below in the form of a "Notification of Alleged Infringement."
                It is Freelancer's policy to respond to clear Notifications of Alleged Infringement, and our policy
                is designed to make submitting Notifications of Alleged Infringement as straightforward as possible
                while reducing the number of Notifications that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to
                understand or verify. If you are a User or subscriber and concerned about the removal of or blocked
                access to your content, please provide Freelancer's Copyright Agent with the written information
                specified below in the form of a "Counter-Notification." The forms specified below are consistent
